This is a series of bash scripts I wrote to work with JRA-55 data from the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS).  The data was first downloaded as tar files over the web in grib format when untarred.  These scripts are useful for untarring and converting from grib to NetCTD4 format using CDO.
